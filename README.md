<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product-Screenshot](images/output.jpg)

### Introduction

Welcome to the "Bekhatereman" Campaign Analysis repository! This project delves into the comprehensive analysis of the #bekhatereman campaign, a remarkable 360-degree digital marketing initiative for Mitsubishi Motors in Iran. As a CSR campaign executed by SISARV Marcom Agency, this campaign not only left a lasting impact but also secured recognition as the Best Campaign of the Year in Iran. This repository is the culmination of an in-depth exploration into the campaign's effectiveness, utilizing a data-driven approach.

### About the Campaign
The #bekhatereman campaign was a strategic endeavor aimed at engaging and resonating with the target audience. Spearheaded by SISARV Marcom Agency, where I served as a Key Account Manager and Creative Strategist, this campaign stood out as a testament to the power of innovative digital marketing.

### Project Overview
In this repository, I have meticulously documented the entire analysis process conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the #bekhatereman campaign. To assess the campaign's impact, I employed two distinct approaches:

1. ***Sentiment Analysis***: Leveraging comments and messages from viewers, I conducted sentiment analysis to gain insights into their interactions with campaign assets.

2. ***Advertising Cost Analysis***: I examined the advertising cost of the campaign to provide a quantitative perspective on its performance.

I adhered to the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology throughout the project, encompassing data imputation, data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and more.

### Methodology
My approach to analyzing the #bekhatereman campaign involved rigorous methodologies and data-driven techniques. Here's an overview of the key steps:

- ***Data Preprocessing***: I meticulously handled data imputations and cleansing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.

- ***Modeling***: In the modeling phase, I harnessed the power of multiple machine learning systems and algorithms to gain a comprehensive understanding of the campaign's effectiveness. A grid search was performed to identify the optimal algorithm and hyperparameter combinations.

### Key Findings
Through this extensive analysis, I unearthed significant and insightful facts that can be harnessed to enhance the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns on Instagram. This project also formed the basis of my master's thesis, reflecting the depth and significance of the insights derived.

### Conclusions
The "Bekhatereman" Campaign Analysis repository encapsulates a journey into the heart of a groundbreaking digital marketing campaign. It not only provides a detailed account of the project but also offers valuable insights that can reshape the landscape of digital marketing on social media platforms like Instagram.
